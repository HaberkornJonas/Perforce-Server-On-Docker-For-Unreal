# Perforce Protections Specification.
#
#  Each line contains a protection mode, a group/user indicator, the
#  group/user name, client host id and a depot file path pattern.
#  A user gets the highest privilege granted on any line.
#
#  Mode:        The permission level or right being granted or denied.  Each
#               permission level includes all the permissions above it,
#               except for 'review'.  Each permission right only includes
#               the specific right and not all the lesser rights. Modes
#               preceded by '=' are rights; all other modes are levels.
#
#               list   - users can see names but not contents of files;
#                        users can see all non-file related metadata
#                        (clients, users, changelists, jobs, etc.)
#
#               read   - users can sync, diff, and print files
#
#               open   - users can add, edit, delete, and integrate files
#
#               write  - users can submit open files
#
#               admin  - permits those administrative commands and command
#                        options that don't affect the server's security
#
#               super  - allows access to the 'p4 protect' command
#
#               review - allows access to the 'p4 review' command; implies
#                        read access
#
#               =read  - if this right is denied, users cannot sync, diff,
#                        or print files
#
#               =branch - if this right is denied, users are not permitted
#                         to use files as a source for 'p4 integrate'
#
#               =open   - if this right is denied, users cannot open files
#                         (add, edit, delete, integrate)
#
#               =write  - if this right is denied, users cannot submit open
#                         files
#
#  Group/User indicator: either 'group' or 'user'.
#
#  Name:        A Perforce group or user name; may be wildcarded.
#
#  Host:        The IP address of a client host; may be wildcarded, or
#               may instead use CIDR syntax, e.g. 172.16.0.0/16 would match
#               all IPv4 addresses which start with 172.16.
#
#  Path:        The part of the depot being granted access.
